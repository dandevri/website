## Who's this for?
This is a **full-day** workshop is for people who want to get more out of their laptop. We'll hack your laptop with tools and utilities to get more out of your system. It's **beginner-friendly** so you won't need any prior knowledge.

## What do I learn?
* We'll hack your laptop with tools and utilities to get more out of your system.
* How to secure your laptop and online accounts
* Navigate the web without being tracked
* Never lose import work by backing-up your device

This workshop has lots of *interactive exercises*, you will **learn by doing**. It is a mix of *fundamentals and principles* and *focus on specific technologies*. You'll leave with *practical tips* you can use immediately.

## What do I bring?
You need to bring your **own laptop** which can be either a Windows or MacOS based system. Most examples are MacOS utilities but 9 out of 10 times there is an Windows alternative. Some software is also available on **smartphones**, bringing one is optional. If you have one it's also a good idea to have an **external hard-drive** for back-ups. You'll get all the resources such as the slides and exercises to go over back at a later time.
