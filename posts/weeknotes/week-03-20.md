The end of this semester is coming to an end and I'm working very hard on the back-end course and my web animation course for next semester at [CMD Amsterdam][cmd]. It will also my first year teaching in our 'beginner programming' course and I'm also doing an in-take for the Basic Teaching Qualification. Next week will be a busy week planning and organizing!

## Project

These weeknotes are now part of a newsletter (which you are probably currently reading). I've chosen [Buttondown.email][buttondown] because of the good markdown experience and basic functionality, no fancy features.

Updates to my personal site include a _/mistake_ page with, you probably guessed it, an incomplete list of my mistakes. I also wanted to track the progress of how my site changed (or evolved) over time so I'm consistenly saving my site to the web-archive.org and made an overview on _/archive_.

## Learning

I started with Wes Bos his [Beginner JavaScript][beginner] course, not really for learning but seeing how Wes teaches tricky concepts. In a couple weeks, I'll teach a [JavaScript Bootcamp][bootcamp] and I'm looking for inspiration for the curriculum. That's why I'm also re-doing his [JavaScript 30][30] course for exercise inspiration.

## Media diet

↪ **Playing**: Got my Sim Racing all set-up so I'm playing tons of [Gran Turismo Sport][gt] on the Playstation 4 but also bought [Ori and the Blind Forest][ori] for the Nintendo Switch.

↪ **Reading**: Finished two college books from Cal Newport and started with [Never Split the Difference][split] by Chris Voss.

↪ **Watching**: [The Toys that made Us][toys] was a fun watch, I was waiting for [Gommorah S4][gom] to hit Netflix and it finally did.
