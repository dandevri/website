We started the last course called 'front-end data' in the tech track of Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied sciences. Students created a static d3.js visualization and are now adding interaction and events to make them more interactive.

Played around with monetization on my personal site, inspired by the [Shop Talk Show episode 379][shoptalk]. You can tip me with BAT if you are using the Brave browser.

## Project

Made a GitHub organization for [Voight][voight] (wip), a small side project where I started working on front-end boilerplates and Syntax / UI themes. I'm currently making a static boilerplate using 11ty, the static site starter, and another one which includes Tailwind CSS. [Deckard][Deckard] is the work in progress name for the UI themes. Still need to have a look and try out some other themes to gather inspiration from. Started with an an Alfred, Slack & Terminal theme and will move on to code editor themes.

## Learning

I postponed this for a long time but I'm finally learning some frameworks to build a couple of sites I want to work on. Starting with React for some reason. I did this [Scrimba React course][scrimba] to make some quick examples and play around with the syntax. Then onto the [Framer Guide to React][framer] to learn some overarching principles. Next up are the plain ol' React docs and the React for Beginners video's from Wes Bos.
