Last week (several times) students confused Design with Art. To me, design is not art, but design is definitely creative. The outcome is more focussed on function, it leans more towards the usability of the product than aesthetic appeal.

Over the last year, I accumulated a lot of small gear but guessed it was time to upgrade my [Every Day Carry][edc]. First up, a  [Victorinox Huntsman][huntsman] to keep as a multi-tool in my bag. 

I'm also starting to broaden my music horizon. I like [classic house music][house] but feel like I'm staying in my lane. Got some good suggestions for discovering new music and artists.

## Links

* An illustration from Damien Newman called [The Design Squiggle][design] of the design process; from research to one single designed solution.
* Fun [talk by Michael Flarup][talk] on how to maintain high creative output while still living your life.
* This article got me thinking about the gamification of fitness; [How I use video games to lose weight and feel fit][fit] by Jeff Ramos.
* 'Accessibility is a perfect indicator for the quality of a website' wrote Manuel Matuzovic in [Bad accessibility equals bad quality][a11y].

## Project

The outline for the [JavaScript Bootcamp][bootcamp] is finished. We feel like these are some of the core JavaScript fundamentals that are good for students. I also worked on my personal website for a bit by adding a `/privacy` page and `/timeless` page with a list of timeless links and products.

## Learning

Daniel Shiffman from [The Coding Train][train] is so fun to watch, I've been watching a couple of his AI, machine learning focussed video's. Kyle Simpson has a [course up on Frontend Masters][kyle] for free that's a great introduction to JavaScript.

## Media diet

↪ **Playing**: Probably about halfway trough [Ori and the Blind Forest][ori] for the Nintendo Wii.

↪ **Reading**: Still reading [Never Split the Difference][split] by Chris Voss. It's good, but not life-changing.

↪ **Watching**: Watched [The Game Changers][game] documentary on Netflix and am six episodes into [Unbelievable][unb].
