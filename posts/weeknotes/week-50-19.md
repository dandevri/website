Worked on the speaking request form for my personal website. It uses [Netlify Forms][forms] which parses the HTML at build time. Setting it up was a breeze.

Currently looking at a couple newsletter providers to see if I can deliver these weeknotes (with some additions) as a weekly newsletter. [Buttondown.email][buttondown] seems like a good fit.

We had a [CMD reconnect][reconnect] session, over 50 Alumni from our program joined for dinner to chat about topics from our curriculum. I was very interested in the gap between our program and actual jobs / internships. And if students were interested in teaching part-time.

## Project

Started working on the Zero Twenty group (wip) which is a private mastermind group for people building digital products. Here is the [GitHub organization][zerotwenty]. The idea is to be a mastermind group, not a community. Working on the [landing page][landing], branding and the [group governance][governance].

## Learning

Reading [Shape Up][shape] from Ryan Singer about Product Development within Basecamp. Complementary read for anyone who's running Design Sprints.

Also working my way trough [Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript][api] from Daniel Shiffman (coding train) Good refresher for anyone dealing with server-side.
