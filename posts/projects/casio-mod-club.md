N O D E uploaded a video in which he modded a Casio F-91W and decided to do the same. [Kees Plattel](https://ikbenke.es/) has a site ([casiomod.club](http://casiomod.club/)) which helped me to figure out which parts to buy.

After that I started buying more vintage Casio watches and slowly building up a nice collection.
