It's a good idea to a 'feed detox' from time to time. To critically look at what you are consuming and remove resources. That means unsubscribing from newsletters, unfollowing people from twitter, etc. I do this every couple of months (did it last week) and it feels like a reset. Sort of a clean slate to cut out the noise that has been accumulating over the past few months.
