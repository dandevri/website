Call me weird but I like looking at people's desks (either in real life at offices or form pictures online). A desk says a lot about a person; how much they value materials and products, if they are organized etc. I'm always on the look-out for new gear that can improve my own workflow and desk set-up at home. I like small little tools that do one thing very well.
