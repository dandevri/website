The topic of yesterday's front-end lesson was inclusive design and it's really amazing to see how interested students are when I'm talking about a11y on the web. 

It gives me hope that when you remove 'the unawareness' around a11y, students really care about creating accessible interfaces. Give them starting points (e.g. alt text, focus styles) to start implementing and they go all-in.
