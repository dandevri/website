'The development industry is tough and you have to prepare students for that too. I expect students who start working to be available during evenings or weekends and to take harsh criticism. Otherwise it's a problem.' 

Absolute bullshit. It's a chicken or the egg dilemma. Is the development world 'hard' or is it created that way? If you educate students with this mindset you are part of creating that unsafe harsh industry. We educate students for professional practice mirroring what companies need but we should also show the business community that things can (and should) be done differently.
