At the beginning of this year I bought a 3D Printer. A Creality Ender 3 V2 to be precise. A couple of months later I'm totally obsessed with 3D printing. I learned so much about how they work, what affects print quality and how to modify already good printers. 70% of all the things I print are more parts for printers.
