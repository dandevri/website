Not advocating for buying cheap products (I'm against consumerism) but more often than not a less expensive product gives you 80% of the value. It also works the other way around. Usually, if you spend a little bit more (let's say 50 euros instead of 30 euros) that gives you a huge spec bump. Not the best example but buying an iPhone falls into this category for me. With the cheaper model, you get 90% of the smartphone 'value?' by paying 60% less than top tier models.
