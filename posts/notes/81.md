'Theming' my days is one of the best things I started doing in the recent months. It's a bit like batch working so clustering similar tasks. Today was a 'meeting' day, a whole day dedicated to meetings, admin (communication), and video calls. This gives me lots of time for deep work in the upcoming weekdays. Instead of letting these meetings fragment my workday (you quickly lose 15 min here or 60 mins there), I can make progress on one big task in particular.
