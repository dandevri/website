Since you planned activities for the day, anything that comes up (trough e-mail or messaging) immediately move that to the next day. Put it on a list (or your inbox) and plan the task for the next day during your daily review. Unless itâ€™s really that urgent and something should be done the same day, but most often that isn't the case.
