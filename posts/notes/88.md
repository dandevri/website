Very proud of my first year CMD Amsterdam students who, with no prior coding experience, create beautiful semantic and well-designed websites after just 6 weeks of learning HTML & CSS. Learning to code is not only learning HTML & CSS. It's about learning about different file formats, folder structure, file paths, large file sizes, different screen sizes, different browsers, indenting your code, validators and many more implicit things.
