Does 'higher punishment' change behavior? E.g. being strict in assessing students does this improve their behavior (and grade) in resits? Especially the last couple of years I'm becoming more 'loose' in my assessments giving higher grades for students that made a considerable effort. I felt like there was no point anymore by being strict and see students lose motivation and failing.
