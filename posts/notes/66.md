Most video hosting platforms suck for (university type of video's not online courses) educational content. I build a plain good ol' page that 'just' uses HTML5 video instead. I don't want ads. I don't want a 'recommended' algorithm. I don't want to pay 100 euros for a pro account. I want a page to showcase the videos. I want to be able to make playlists. I want to be able to customize the player. A 'basic' HTML page fulfills al those needs. No need to upload my video's to a third-party platform.
