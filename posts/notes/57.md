What’s weird to me is that people that are 10+ my age (like 30) or even older, care about things I’ve already 'moved past'. It feels like they care about the micro-stuff, about workflows, about tools, things that feel irrelevant to me. It feels like I’ve already been ‘over that’. And each time I think; 'wow, what if I’m at that age'. How much can my views and opinions change?
