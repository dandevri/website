More people should be prototyping. The purpose of prototyping is not to create 'hi-fi dribbble shots' but to learn. The whole point of a prototype should be to 'throw it away' at a later point. You don't want to be attached to it. I see students work on one prototype and stop experimenting. That's why prototyping on paper works really well, it feels quick and dirty.
