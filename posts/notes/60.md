Why do we teach students who have no prior coding experience the fundamentals? Why should they know the difference between `<em>` or `<strong>`? Why should we teach them how to float something to lay-out? Isn't it best to teach students good mental models and the latest spec? So not always the history of how a thing came to be but how to achieve something right now with the easiest to understand syntax.
