Some sort of pre-made template is a powerful way to get me going. Having some sort of starting point really helps me to just start doing and working on something. Like journaling; an empty page scares me but a template with a couple of pre-defined questions (from the bullet journal template) works wonders. It was really hard for me to get into the habit of journaling but having that pre-defined template changed everything. I've been journaling steadily for the last two months and never skipped a day.
