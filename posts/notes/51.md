I was forced to watch footage of me giving a lecture and couldn't watch until the end. It took me off guard to see that I'm very 'strict' when I'm speaking. It's completely different in how I talk with individual students or helping them with their work. In those situations, I'm way more personal and enthusiastic. Overall a more 'fun' teacher. It feels like when I'm speaking (lecturing) I need to deliver my story, straight to the point with no mistakes. That focus makes me a very different person which probably has an impact on the ambiance of the classroom.
