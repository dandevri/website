[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time
