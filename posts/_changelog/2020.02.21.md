title: First release
description: Rather than moving the needle further, I spend a night going down a rabbit hole that does leave me without much to show, but I still consider it progress.

With the creation of a [changelog page](dandevri.es/changelog) I decided to create a 'release' for my personal website. The changes of this site use _calver_, a convention based on a release calendar instead of arbitrary numbers.

My work on this site started on July 22, 2019 that's when I made the first commit on GitHub. I've been slowly making incremental updates since then which results in the code you are viewing now. With releases I'm documenting all my thoughts, the process, and decisions that went into creating my personal site.

This site has a roadmap which is currently a private Notion board in which I keep all ideas, enhancement and improvements to this website. There are currently about 50+ ideas or things I want to implement. For now it's private but I turn it a public roadmap one day.
