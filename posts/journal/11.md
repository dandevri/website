July marks the end of the study year at CMD Amsterdam. It's time for a well received summer vacation after teaching fully digital for a couple of months. This break is a great time for me to work on unfinished side projects, play my backlog of video games and tinker with sensors and coding projects. This month was also the end of the _Basic Teaching Qualification_ course which I passed with flying colours. I'm 'officially' a teacher, I guess.
