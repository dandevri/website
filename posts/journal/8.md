This year (for the second time) I'm part of the Ladies That UX Amsterdam mentorship program! The mentorship program is open to everyone and absolutely free. It's a 4 months program where mentors will be matched with mentees based on their preferences and on what they want to learn. If we are matched we'll meet for 30 minutes every two weeks to talk about what you want to learn.
