title: 2020 - February
description: The holidays are over and I'm slowly picking things up again. Spent the days between Christmas and New Year to do my **annual review** in which I set new goals. A lot of things that were just 'plans' in 2019 are quickly becoming reality.

Today was my first day of the Basic Teaching Qualification. What struck me was that all of us encounter the same 'problems' and there are a lot of similarities when teaching that are not related to specific course subject content. Our group has about +20 teachers that all work in different programs of our university. That difference and diversity of people's views and opinions about teaching is really inspiring.
