Yesterday was my birthday. Strange times. It was a slow and quiet birthday with family playing board games. Students sang 'happy birthday' in my virtual classroom. I could only hear their voices, no faces. I also bought some home office upgrades; a file cabinet, a microphone arm and a pair of new studio monitors as a gift to myself. From September onwards most of the education will continue online so I might as well invest in good gear for my desk.
