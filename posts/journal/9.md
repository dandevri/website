Due to Covid-19, there is no physical education at the Amsterdam University. I've been teaching completely online for the last couple of weeks. Virtual Classrooms (and maybe online teaching in general) feels a lot like live streaming. It drains your 'teacher battery' quickly but I'm amazed at how well students handle the situation. Next week two new classes will start fully online. I will teach a whole new class without ever meeting them in 'real life'. That's probably a good 'experiment' to see how far you can go with online connections.
