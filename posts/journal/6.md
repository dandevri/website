The holidays are over and I'm slowly picking things up again. Spent the days between Christmas and New Year to do my **annual review** in which I set new goals. A lot of things that were 'plans' in 2019 will become reality in 2020.

I also did a lot of planning in November and December last year;
collecting ideas, reaching out to people and cancelling things to create more time to work on exciting projects in 2020.
