 A desk says a lot about a person; how much they value materials and products, if they are organized etc. I'm always on the look-out for new gear that can improve my own workflow and desk set-up at home. I like small little tools that do one thing very well.

This post idea sparked from the fact that I've been building a small Daniel Shiffman inspired workspace over at our university. And since that whole pandamic thing happened I've also been slowly incrementally upgrading my own home office as well. I've been testing out different types of gear to see if they could improve my workflow. 

Your setup might look different, it went from just a desk with a laptop and speakers to almost a full fledged recording studio since I'm recording more and more screencasts and doing tons of online teaching. Not all this gear is my own, I'm very privileged to use gear from the university that we have available. Not a luxury that everyone has and with that comes the disclaimer that _expensive gear_ isn't a necessity. It's not like all of this gear make me a better teacher but it does help in some shape or way. 

_*Apart from the Soundboard on my Elgato Stream Deck, my students think it's the best. They even send me over sound to include on the soundboard to use during lessons. If you should buy one piece of gear, it should be a sound board._

### /uses pages

That's also why I'm obsessed with the `/uses/` format (page) on people's personal website. I think it's a thing [Wes Bos](#) started and there is even a whole GitHub repo where people can submit their own `/uses/` page. I have one of my own on this website if you haven't noticed from the sidebar over on the left already.

The only problem I have is that most of people's uses pages only list items like gear, apps and software but don't often include pictures. That's were for me Reddit comes into play; `/r/macsetups`, `/r/battlestations` are places where people post their set-ups.  Every couple of weeks I go trough those feeds and store inspiration in a Notion board for later reference.
