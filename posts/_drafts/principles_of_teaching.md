After almost 2 years of full-time teaching, I still have no clue what makes a good teacher. You pick up little tricks along the way but I don't think there is one clear blueprint. But, after reading a ton of feedback from my students and reading evaluation from courses I do think that there are a couple of overarching principles that are generally applicable.

Dieter Rams has his 10 principles of good design. I've condensed my list down to _Danny's 10 principles of being a good instructor._

```
  A good instructor...
```

01 - gives structure

Gives his students clear deadlines. Has an overview of the timetable and is clear in this communication to students. Helps them to study "effectively" and organize their own time.

02 - is easily accessible

Does not leave any question unanswered. That doesn't necessarily mean that there must be a "fast" response, but it must be timely and the student needs to have the trust that you will always get back to them. With every question or problem a student has you actively collaborate to find a solution.

03 - actively seeks student feedback

Asks students what they think of the lessons and takes moments to reflect on them. Also asks for feedback in time (during the course) instead of at the end of a course. Looks critically at the course evaluations of previous years and schedules evaluations with colleagues.

04 - is not "above" the students

Teaches subject content not as an expert but as an instructor. Not telling the student "how to do it" but "let's figure it out together". Matches the student's competence level and helps them achieve small victories.

05 - can be tough and critical.

You are not a good instructor if you have become _instructor of the year_. Being a good instructor doesn't always mean you must be the most _likeable_. You are a good instructor if you teach your subject well and students look back on your course as something where they have learned a lot.

06 - let's students provide input.

Teaches in collaboration with the student. Asks for input from students on a lesson plan or course material. Tailor the lesson to what students need at that moment and thinks about the situational factors of the student.

07 - can convey his subject content with enthusiasm.

Speaks from expertise but can explain this in understandable language (curse of knowledge) while being enthousiastic about his own content every single time. Creates a safe atmosphere (relationship).

08 - has an eye for every student.

Leave enough space, during class, for questions and give each student enough personal attention (time) to solve their problems. A good teacher really wants the student to understand it. Provides the student with insight into his or her own progress. Creates a safe atmosphere.

09 - shows doesn't tell

Explains subject content with practical examples: live demos, diagrams, visual strength etc. Show instead of speech or a couple of slides.

10 - breaks through the culture of non-commitment.

Gives direct feedback in a systematic way and avoids procrastination with active teaching methods and formative assignments. By handling solutions to assignments in class (strength of the group).
