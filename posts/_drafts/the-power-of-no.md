Not doing something is also a decision. For me, the best way to figure out all the things I have to do was figuring out which ones not to do at all. Use the power of a solid 'no' to prioritize and regain your focus.

## Busy work

The first thing you should do is identify _'shallow work'_. A term coined by Cal Newport in his Book Deep Work. In practice I find that most of the requests from other people are people asking me to do 'shallow work'. Easy to replicate tasks you don't really want to be doing in the first place. Like scheduling a meeting, 'hopping on a quick call' for feedback, filling in grades into a spreadsheet, updating slides for a lecture.

## No should be your default answer

Saying no can be really hard. Whenever someone approaches you with a request, your default answer should be 'no'.

> You rarely regret saying no but you often regret saying yes.

Here is my usual response:

> $firstname, thanks so much for reaching out. Unfortunately, I need to say no to $thing. I don't have a lot of time available so \$thing is currently not a priority. I don't think I'd be able to give this the attention I'd like to.

I honestly always thank the person for reaching out and then go straight into the hard 'no' while also explaining on why I'm saying no by telling that it's not my primary focus. If it's something you can't say a hard 'no' to at least take some time before making your decision. Just let that e-mail sit in your inbox for a day and come back to it the following day.

Sometimes you get a hairy reaction when you decline, it's hard not to worry about those reactions but that person is probably not valueing your time anyway so don't bother. That doesn't mean you should be rude, you should strive to be 'clear' not 'rude'. If I can think of something I'll always pointing someone in the right suggestion or offer alternative people to contact.

## Not doing list

Every time somebody asks me for a tasks or makes a request that I don't feel like doing and want to avoid in the future I put it onto my **not doing list**. It's the opposite of a to-do list. Things like **not attending meetings with no clear agenda** or **never video call if something can be written (async communication)** are on top of my not-doing list.
