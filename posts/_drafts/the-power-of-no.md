Not doing something is also a decision. For me, the best way to figure out all the things I have to do was figuring out which ones not to do at all. Use the power of a solid 'no' to prioritize and regain your focus. It's not about getting more done, it's abouting creating more time by saying no. It's easy to say yes but hard to say no.

> The best way to get out of low-priority obligations is to say no in the first place. Make Time.

The first thing you should do is identify _'shallow work'_. A term coined by Cal Newport in his Book Deep Work. In practice I find that most of the requests (90% rule) from other people are people asking me to do 'shallow work'. Easy to replicate tasks, that don't create any value and you don't really want to be doing in the first place. Like scheduling a meeting, 'hopping on a quick call' for feedback, filling in grades into a spreadsheet, updating slides for a lecture. It takes a lot to convice me to agree to something that yields shallow work. It's their responsibility to convince you of something you should be doing.

Saying yes to shallow work doesn't mean you get more done. It just means you work more for no good reason.

If somebody makes a request a good to thing to ask is if I say no to this, **what could I be doing instead?** Those small request are just interruptions. If you are not _getting your 'main thing' work done_ it's probaby because you are saying yes to all these insignificant requests.

Then you should transition from a 'yes' to a 'no'. Greg McKeown puts this really nicely in his 'essentialism model' in his book:

- 'I have to' → 'I choose to'
- Say yes without thinking → 'Say no to everything except the essential
- 'React to what's most pressing → Pause to discern what really matters
- Takes on too much → Chooses carefully

> If you don't prioritise your life, someone else will.

You will always have control over the options since you can choose. If you are in doubt or it isn't a clear yes, you should say no. You deny the request, not the person. You should almost never put the priorities of another person above your own priority.

- Get away of the opinion that you should say yes because people will 'like you more'. Often times it's the reverse. By saying no you are signaling to the other person that your time is valuable and people might respect you more for that. It's the trade-off between being popular or respected.
- Do you have the time to say yes? Before you say yes think about how much you have.
- Is this a priority for you or is the task better suited for another person? Often somebody else is better in handling the request and has more speciality.
- Do you feel like doing it? I sometimes just say no because I don't feel like doing it and I want to focus on other things that give me joy.
- A clear no is better than a 'kinda' yes.

## No should be your default answer

Saying no can be really hard. Whenever someone approaches you with a request, your default answer should be 'no'. E-mail is convenient for the one who sends you the mail in the first place They have questions about their priorities not yours when it's convention for them, not you.

> You rarely regret saying no but you often regret saying yes.

Here is my usual response:

> $firstname, thanks so much for reaching out. Unfortunately, I need to say no to $thing. I don't have a lot of time available so \$thing is currently not a priority. I don't think I'd be able to give this the attention I'd like to.

I honestly always thank the person for reaching out and then go straight into the hard 'no' while also explaining on why I'm saying no by telling that it's not my primary focus. If it's something you can't say a hard 'no' to at least take some time before making your decision. Just let that e-mail sit in your inbox for a day and come back to it the following day.

Sometimes you get a hairy reaction when you decline, it's hard not to worry about those reactions but that person is probably not valueing your time anyway so don't bother. That doesn't mean you should be rude, you should strive to be 'clear' not 'rude'. If I can think of something I'll always pointing someone in the right suggestion or offer alternative people to contact.

If you don't have something to do you say yes to all little incoming responses just to have something next to do or do stuff in a visible manner instead of focussing on more important work. You default to shallow work instead of doing something more important.

When you decline be nice but honest. Don't make up excuses, don't make half commitments. Just make it a solid no.

## Not doing list

Every time somebody asks me for a tasks or makes a request that I don't feel like doing and want to avoid in the future I put it onto my **not doing list**. It's the opposite of a to-do list. Things like **not attending meetings with no clear agenda** or **never video call if something can be written (async communication)** are on top of my not-doing list. With a not-doing list you set-up your own boundaries.

In make time Jake also mentiones a 'might-do' list. They sit on this list until you decide to do them. I usually put a label on those tasks in my to-do app and only do those at the end of the day. If something doesn't feel relevant anymore the next day, I remove it.
