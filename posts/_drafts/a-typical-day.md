I saw a bunch of people on twitter sharing a post about their typical day. I've always wanted to add a `daily-routine` page on this website so I thought it was nice to chime in.

I'm a sucker for looking at people desks, but I'm also fascinated how other people's days are. Things like routines and habits that develop over time. Here is mine.

**7:00-8:00**

On _most days_, I Wake up anywhere between this time slot. My alarm defaults to 7:00 but I snooze so sometimes I go straight out of bed, on other days I like to lay down for a little bit longer. I get up and make a good quality cup of coffee. I don't eat breakfast. While sipping on my coffee I like to listen to a podcast, read some articles or pick up my book. Iâ€™ll let my mind wander during the first hour of wake-up.

**8:00-9:00**

When the cafeine kicks the next hour is spend doing some stretching with some home gym equipment or a small walk around the house and getting myself dressed and ready for the day. During this time I also like to do some cleaning around the house. Make the bed, take out the trash, clean up the set-up etc. I can't work when things are cluttered. During the pandemic I'm able to do this. Otherwise this time is spend commuting to Amsterdam by train.

**9:00-12:00**

I do atleast 3 hours of focussed time. I am very protective of these hours when scheduling meetings. I don't open up e-mail, I don't respond to messages. This is 3 hours of deep work. I focus on doing my Highlight for the day that I set in Notion the day before. But on most days this time is spend teaching students.


**12:00-13:00**

Lunch. I get away from the computer and sit in the kitchen. I either do some light reading like browsing twitter or again reading articles. I'll sometimes watch some Youtube video's. I like to spend some time making _unique_ lunch. I enjoy cooking and lunch is a great opportunity to be a little more creative instead of just eating a sandwich.

**13:00-16:00**

Another three hours of very focussed work. No e-mail, no messages. I continue working on my highlights or any high priority tasks that need to be finished. At around 15:00 I'll often have a quick break to grab some fruit. But again on most days this time is spend teaching students.

**16:00-17:00**

If it's a 'quit' day I'll either continue working on priority tasks but otherwise at the end of the day I plan my meetings, do some more administrative (shallow work) and respond to e-mail and messages. All comunication have flowed into my inbox and I can batch process most of these things.

**17:00-17:30**

Daily review time. I have a Notion board with a list of things I go trough. Like reviewing my calendar for tomorrow, checking my tasks, writing in my Journal and reading feedbin and any other social media stuff.

**17:30-18:30**

Dinner time. Cooking, doing the dishes the usual. My dinners are device-less. Just me and my food nothing else.

**18:30-20:00**

Another small focussed sprint, 

**20:00-20:30**

Tea time.

**20:30-22:00**

Another small sprint to work on personal projects. But not very intens. So this is where I do mo of my writing, working on my personal website or do some learning (doing an online course etc.). I allow myself to work on whatever I feel like working on.

**22:00-23:00(ish)**

Wind-down time. It usually consists of me reading a little bit and then watching a series. Or this hour is spend playing a video-game on my console. It takes me a long time to fall asleep so I like to wind-down first and usualy am sleeping by 23:00.

My days consist of around ~6 hour actual working hours. I think that's quite reasonable and I'm very hyperfocused during those hours which is a skill I very much glad I developer over the couple of years.

The other ~3/4 hours in the evening are me working on personal projects, products or writing. These are very flexible. Some days I skip it all together and just hop on the couch or do other stuff. I like this schedule, so I always have time in my day for play and exploration. Knowing that my 'important' worked is finished reliefs alot of stress for me.

Interested in how I work? I've written a whole [user guide](/guides/user-guide) about myself about communication, how I work with people and personality.

*Some sidenotes:
* Have a more consistent cardio / sporting habit. I usually take a walk or spend a couple of times at my home gyme in the garage but I don't have a rigid sporting schedule.
* I need a lot of time to 'get started'. That's why I start my days pretty late. But I also like to continue a little bit longer in the evening. I like to work on personal projects after dinner.
* This is my day during this pandamic thing which leaves out commute time. Whenever things get back to normal the morning and evenings are filled with ~1 hour commutes.
* I heavily rely on my calendar to time box my tasks. I should probably write another post about how I schedule my calendar etc.
