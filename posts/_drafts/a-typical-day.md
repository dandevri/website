I saw a bunch of people on twitter sharing a post about their typical day. I've always wanted to add a `daily-routine` page on this website so I thought it was nice to chime in.

I'm a sucker for looking at people desks, but I'm also fascinated how other people's days are. Things like routines and habits that develop over time. Here is mine.

There are two things where I would like to improve;
* Have a more consistent cardio / sporting habit. I usually take a walk or spend a couple of times at my home gyme in the garage but I don't have a rigid sporting schedule.
* I need a lot of time to 'get started'. That's why I start my days pretty late. But I also like to continue a little bit longer in the evening.
* This is my day during this pandamic thing which leaves out commute time. Whenever things get back to normal the morning and evenings are filled with ~1 hour commutes.
* I heavily rely on my calendar to time box my tasks. I should probably write another post about how I schedule my calendar etc.
