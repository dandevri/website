Using GitHub for the first time has a steep learning curve. To use GitHub with a team is a whole different ball game. Here are some best practices Iâ€™ve come to know during my team projects.

Throughout the various OSS projects that I contributed to one thing always takes up more time than I expect. **Setting a Git(Hub) standard **for working on a repository. (or* repo* as the cool kids say it) Below are some best practices that really helped me along the way.

### Project your branches.

The first thing that prevents headaches in the future is to protect the master branch and make a develop one right away. It disables **force pushing **and prevents branches from being **deleted**. A great way to protect youâ€™re project and make sure that you donâ€™t have to ðŸš‘ hotfix anything if you use *continuous integration *for example.

### Consistent branch naming.

With the master branch protected contributors canâ€™t push straight into master. They have to use branches and make pull requests. Coming up with a **naming convention **for the branches is very helpful. One of the things is to use **prefixes:**

* fix/...

* feature/...

* enhancement/...

* And so onâ€¦

In a quick overview you can see what each branch is for and they have consistent naming.

### Pull requests.

Make sure PRâ€™s canâ€™t be merged without a required review. If you protect a branch you can also enable Require pull request reviews before merging. Every PR that comes in has to be reviewed by another contributor.

So, merging is blocked by default. A contributor has to manually navigate to the PR and hit review changes. You then can either:

* Make **comments** for general feedback. (No explicit approval)

* **Approve **the changes and the PR can be merged

* **Request changes, **things that have to be fixed before merging.

A great way to get a quick quality check before the code get merged.

* It keeps the overall quality of the code on point.

* More eyes ðŸ‘€ are better. Somebody else can spot a mistake you might have missed.

* And personally, I think itâ€™s a good way to learn by looking at somebody elseâ€™s code.

### Commit messages.

Oh god, commit messages. Always a painful topic to talk about. Everyone has a personal / preferred way to do it. **Chris Beam** has written a great post about this in 2014. It are some general rules but most people find them acceptable.
> You should definitely read the [full post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Here are his seven golden rules:

1. [Separate subject from body with a blank line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#separate)

1. [Limit the subject line to 50 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50)

1. [Capitalize the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#capitalize)

1. [Do not end the subject line with a period](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#end)

1. [Use the imperative mood in the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative)

1. [Wrap the body at 72 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#wrap-72)

1. [Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how)*

Ideally your commit title would look like this:

    Add styling for navigation bar

Usually these rules are outlined in the contributing.md and examples are given.

### Plan your commits.

Guilty as charge of commiting a large blob of code. But, planning your commits is also a good strategy to keep yourself in check. Before you go straight into building that feature try to break the feature down into small steps. Each step then represents a commit. [Here](https://dev.to/rpalo/plan-your-commits) is a quick little post on **dev.to **about this.

### Gitmoji.

Last but not least the holy grail of commit messages. **GITMOJI ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¦„ðŸ”¥. **Made by[ Carlos Cuesta](https://carloscuesta.me) Gitmoji has to be one of my favorite CLI tools.
> [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) is an initiative to standardize and explain the use of emojis on GitHub commit messages.

Itâ€™s great cause it forces you to categorize your commits and even better, in the history you can easily spot the core of each commit and recognize it by itâ€™s emoji.

You can use Gitmoji from the command line by installing it globally.

    npm i -g gitmoji-cli

in the project you want to use Gitmoji type:

    gitmoji -i

![Gitmoji dialog in HyperTerm.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*u04Qy98Dnc3hL2wwtNaAcg.png)*Gitmoji dialog in HyperTerm.*

From now on every git commit (or gc for the oh my zsh users out there) pops up the gitmoji dialog and before you can write youâ€™re title you have to pick a gitmoji.
> Coming up with a consistent GitHub standard and flow may take some time but itâ€™s worth it in the long run. It makes the repo far more maintainable and has saved me from these kind of situations:
