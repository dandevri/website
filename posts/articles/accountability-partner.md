**General introduction about keeping yourself accountability. Why I needed an accountabiliyt partner** I f you think you will reach your own goals, it's still good to work with a accountability partner. You can talk on your own if you reached your goals but you don't get any feedback from them, sometimes people can tweak your goal or 'zet je op het verkeerde been' with new insights.

## My Partner

Miranda Endhoven is a collegua at CMD Amsterdam and runs Mediabear a digital agency that helps entrepreneurs to become visible on the (quite saturated) web and to grow their business through handy, online tools. We started chatting after we both talked about a couple of books we've read and how we both were heavily influenced by [Grip][grip] from [Rick Pastoor][rick].

To quote Rick Pastoor

> You give this person permission to say things you may not want to hear.

That's sums up really nicely what is so powerful about a partner, especially one that isn't a close friend or family member. Asking each other (positive) critical questions it what makes this work and close friends or family member might be hesitant to give you genuine feedback.

## How we work
We meet about every month trough a video call. Each of us talks 20 minutes about how their month went and what goals to focus on for next month. We felt like monthly meetings and monthly goals work best, quarterly targets where to long and weekly or bi-weekly meetings where a bit short in time frame.

Each meeting has a standard format, we ask eachother the same three questions:

1. What went well last month and why?
2. What could I have done better?
3. What goals do I work on this month?

Optionally we talk about work-life balance and in general how we feel. It's also a good idea to discuss your _no-go zones_ topics you don't want to talk about. We decided that talking about our daily work as teachers and finance weren't all that relevant. 

Give it a try, it might work for you as well.

_I've exported our Notion board to a [google doc][doc]. Feel free to use it as a template for your own sessions!_
