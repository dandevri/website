So, a little over a week ago I attended CSS Day (hosted by Krijn Hoetmer and Peter-Paul Koch) in the Compagnietheater Amsterdam. Here are some of my impressions.

Since I started calling myself a designer iâ€™ve attended some conferences and meetups. Ranging from big trendy hipster tech conferences (TNW for example) to small meetupâ€™s hosted basically in living rooms. All of them had something in common; they were mainly focused on *visual design*.

CSS Day was something else. It was my first ever conference that focuses on *development* and the vibe was incredible. ðŸŽ‰

## The Venue.

Around 8:30 me and my good friend [Rijk van Zanten](undefined) walked towards the Compagnietheater. It was a hot day but despite that we were looking forward to all the interesting talks.
> # After greeting Krijn, picking up our badge, and drinking the first cup of coffee for the day we headed to the main hall and took a seat in the front row.

## The People.

What stood out to me was the diversity of all the people sitting in the hall. From senior developers that have worked on the web for ages, to students (myself included) who have not even written *3000 rules of css. *There were *3[*54 attendees](https://cssday.nl/2017/attendees) in total and to throw even more numbers at you, [here](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2017/06/women_speakers.html) are some more statistics by *PPK* which shows the ratio of the crowd.

## The Talks.

With my Moleskine sketchbook on my lap I was ready to endure the 7 hours filled with talks and amazing content. Would have loved to cover them all but since I have to cook dinner in a minute, here are the ones that [blew my mind.](https://giphy.com/search/Mind-Blown)

### Ruth John â€” The Web Audio API

I found out the hard way that the [Web Audio API](https://cssday.nl/2017/programme#ruth-john) isnâ€™t just to play and pause audio. In Ruth her talk we took a deep dive into the API and I still think we just saw the tip of the iceberg. The examples showed incredible audio manipulations that I didnâ€™t think were possible. You can see all of her examples and slides in [this github repo.](https://github.com/Rumyra/Talk-Web-Audio)

### Ada Rose Edwards â€” WebVR

VR is all the hype. When the word *VR* drops most people think of expensive hardware that *needs *to be used in order to get a VR experience. The opposite is true. It may surprise you but you can actually create a[mazing VR experiences on the everyday web.](https://cssday.nl/2017/programme#ada-rose-edwards)

Before the talk we all got a ~google~mozilla cardboard to put our phones in and Ada Rose showed us this [demo.](https://metaverz.herokuapp.com) Do I need to say more?

### Patrick Kettner â€” Progressive Web Apps
> # Are progressive web apps really that [*progressive](https://cssday.nl/2017/programme#patrick-kettner)?*

During the last couple weeks I optimised some node projects to make them meet the PWA key principles. Since I know some fundamentals of PWAâ€™s Patrick his talk was really inspiring.

One of the biggest key principles is **progressive **(duh, itâ€™s in the name) but if you follow the PWA key principles it doesnâ€™t necessary mean that your app is truly progressive.

Service workers for example, they donâ€™t work on every browser. Sometimes you need to use other alternatives. To make your PWA truly progressive, you canâ€™t always rely on the hot new and shiny techniques. You sometimes have to use APIâ€™s that are as old as the web itself.

## Kind Regards.

A huge thanks to [*Krijn Hoetmer](https://krijnhoetmer.nl) *for providing the tickets to the **Browser API special day**. To close this off, here is a picture of us sitting on a bench. Because sitting on a bench on CSS Day made us look cool. ðŸ¦„
