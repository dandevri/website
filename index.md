Hi! I'm Danny de Vries (@dandevri), which you've probably already guessed from the header above. I'm passionate about tinkering with code, brand identities and web development. My approach is organized, systematic and inclusive.

I'm an Indie Maker building digital products for the web, working and helping small companies trough my tiny design studio and lecture about building for the web at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.

**Speaking**

I give talks and guest lecture at conferences, universities or offices. You should totally ask me to speak. My talks are brief and to the point with lots of examples and actionable tips. You can also ask me to host and moderate your event, like a MC but without the rap.

**Teaching**

You'll usually find me in front of a classroom at the Amsterdam University but I also share what I learn by giving full-day workshops and creating online classes and courses so you can learn with me around the web.

**Projects**

Sometimes I tinker with code or create DIY projects. Most of them are just fun side projects that have no meaning at all and aren't for anybody to use.

**Contact**

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. You can e-mail, chat or follow me on social.
