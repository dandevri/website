<p>My brief talks are around ~30 minutes and are well suited for office talks and meet-ups at your company. These talks are full of practical tips, short examples and lots of resources for you to get back to work.</p>

<p><em>You can also find most of my talks and slides on my <a href="https://noti.st/dandevri">noti.st</a> or <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dandevri">Speaker Deck</a> account.</em></p>
