## Presence
* I move quite a lot when I'm on stage. I like to walk around, move towards the audience.
* I use a ton of gestures to enhance my speech.
* I use my voice a lot. I believe in something and want others to share that feeling.

## Expenses
* If the event is located in my current location (Amsterdam, NL) or remote I don't expect you to pay for my travel expenses.
* I expect you to pay for the travel expenses if it's an international event. Either you purchase it or I can reimburse it afterwards.
* I expect you to pay for the lodging if it's an international event. Either you purchase it or I can reimburse it afterwards.
* If I speak at your event I expect to also have a ticket to the full conference.

## Presentation
* I own and retain the rights to official recordings of my presentation and grant you license to use, modify, and redistribute them. (I want to publish a copy of the talk on my own Youtube channel)
* I will not use branded content like branded templates or slides designed for the event.
* I usually have a ton of images and diagrams to make concepts more clear. I take time to design my slides.
* I personally choose to have many slides with a small amounts on each. I like the fast-paced flow.
* It's ok to use my resources (photography, bio) on social media leading up to the event.
* No censorship.

## Setup and AV
* Lapel or lavalier preferred. No handheld.
* Lectern (or table) preferred.
* Timer viewable from the stage is preferred.
* Confidence monitor preferred. I need to be able to see my slides and notes.
* USB-C or HDMI preferred. I'll usually have adapters.
* A wall socket preferred. For charging my computer.
* A Wi-Fi connection is preferred, although most of my slides also work offline.
* Presenting from my own laptop and settings is preferred. 
* I will not create my slides in other programs then I'm currently using myself (keynote).

## Accessibility
* Provide open captioning for the audience.
* Ensure all official event venues are accessible to people with mobility issues, including people who use wheelchairs. This includes the stage and social gatherings around the event.
* Reserve some seating in the front rows for people with vision impairments.
* Run a financial aid, scholarship, opportunity grant, or similar program for attendees.
* If providing or otherwise facilitating meals, be responsive to people with dietary restrictions.

## Inclusive
* No all white male panels.
* Gender parity with men, women, and nonbinary people.
* Include people with disabilities, people of color, and LGBTQIA+ people.
* Offer scholarschip programs or discounted tickets for students.

## Privacy 
* Attendee data/information should not be sold, especially not to conference sponsors.
* Attendees should have the option to not be included in promotion material. (excluded from video or photography)

## Withdrawal
* Life can be messy and I reserve the right to withdraw from your conference. I always try to do it well in advance and notify you. I try to find a replacement speaker.
* If this happens, I will no longer want to be associated with your event.
* It will be my last resort.
