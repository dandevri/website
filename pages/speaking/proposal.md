_When I'm sending out the proposal I'll usually include my speaker information (biography, photos etc.) along with the proposal._

**More tips and tricks:**
* If your proposal is too much work to read or understand, it will get skipped in the selection process.
* Do not propose a topic that you think will get you on stage but doesn't get you excited.
* Talk about the topics not about yourself. Don't pitch your company.
* Attendees decide on talks in the moment, make sure you're title and brief description are inviting.
* Write “you” sentences, it's natural to write the proposal from first person.
