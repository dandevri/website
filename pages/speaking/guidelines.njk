<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>I'm passionate to talk about topics that are important to me, but also try and tailor my talk to your event. It would be great if you could give me some information <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/my-questions-for-event-organizers/">before the event.</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>What kind of topic you’d like me to talk about?</li>
  <li>What kind of audience will attend?</li>
  <li>How many attendees are you expecting at the event?</li>
  <li>Any technical details I should be aware of?</li>
</ul>

<p>The sooner you get in touch about your event, the better. Upcoming events are listed on the speaking page so you can see my general availability. I usually plan ~6 months in advance.</p>

<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>The events that I'm attending and speaking at are <a href="/speaking">listed here</a> but that doesn't cover it all. I also run workshops in-house and lecture at the amsterdam university. Not sure if I'm available? <a href="contact">Ask me!</a></p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>I only speak at events that have a <strong>code of conduct</strong> enforced. Your event should have a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Your venue should be <strong>accessibile for all</strong>. Your line-up should be <strong>diverse</strong>. I'll usually <strong>volunteer</strong> to speak at schools, local communities, local meetups and universities.</p>

<p>My fee can change based on the type of event. If I have to create a new talk and slide deck, then I expect to be <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/12/state-of-commercial-web-conferences-events/">paid for the the time</a> that goes into <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/14363">preparing</a> it.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>If the talk is recorded I expect it to be available for free to everyone. If the slide deck doesn't contain any confidential information I'll usually <a href="https://slides.com/dandevri">share it publicly</a> along with all the examples and external resources. I'm happy to provide the deck in advance.</p>

<p>I will use my MacBook (jup the one with USB-C only ports, dongle life) to control my deck created with slides.com. I present best when my speaker notes are visible to me during the talk, if possible, trough a speaker monitor on the ground (ted style).I take care and pride in the design of my deck so they are <a href="https://presentation.design/">good looking</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/inclusive-design-accessible-presentations/">readable to all.</a><p>

<h2>Expenses</h2>

<p>I expect to be <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/12/state-of-commercial-web-conferences-events/">paid to speak</a> at a commercial event. Travel expenses (flights, ground transportation and accommodation) are expected to be <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1072462796191907841">covered up front</a>. I’m an independent creator, my costs are not covered by a <a href="https://mrrobot.fandom.com/wiki/E_Corp">'E Corp'</a> that I work for. </p>
