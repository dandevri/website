## Preparation
* **Follow the conference**, event or meet-up on social to receive updates.
* **Bring your own water bottle**. You don't want to pour glasses from a jug.

## At the conference
* **Be on time and let organizers know you've arrived.** Ask for final bits of information.
* **Remove the lanyard** or tuck it away in your pocket.
* **Put your smartphone in your backpack** (airplane mode), don't have it in your pocket.
* **Get your computer ready** to go
  * Turn off the speakers
  * Turn off notifications
  * Disable sleep mode
  * Check if audio and video works
  
## Before the talk
* **Wait off-stage** (out of view) instead of being on the stage when somebody introduces you.
* **Thank the MC for the introduction**, have some human-interaction before speaking.

## After the talk
* On the final slide, **thank the audience for their time** and share the url to the slides.
* **Let the audience know they can approach you** during breaks to ask questions.
* **Pack up your things** and make room for the next speaker.
* **Get off stage** quickly and confidently.
* **Stay silent** for a bit after the talk is finished, to make sure the mic is really off.
* **Share the slides** on social media (twitter)
* **Thank everyone involved**, all the volunteers, AV teams etc.
* I've **been given speaker gifts** but sometimes I can't take them with me (cannot transport, don't have enough space in my bag or gifts aren't allowed on the plan)
