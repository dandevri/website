## 1. Make digital better
Digitale products should improve the lifes of people. It should be inclusive and delight them. I focus on digital products so everything I do is made in the browser fully interactive, responsive mobile-first, web-ready assets clickable etc.

## 2. Design is a Job
You come to me because you need something that you probably can't do on your own. I'm prety straight forward in my communication and you should give me the space to do my thing. Pay me.

## 3. Stay Connected
The best things happen when we [stay connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZT2AXgGzAU) and work together. I thrive on feedback and constant communication. the best work happens in a committed relationship. I can collaborate with multiple disciplines. Direct and honest communication

## 4. Move fast
Make quick and small prototypes, then continuously improve. I've noticed it's best to just ship something as 'living' and then build upon it. Improve with small steps and make it better 1% each time.

## 5. Question everything
I don't have all the answers. I'm not qualified for anything. I start with the why and then continuously learn and self-improve.

## 6. Help others
I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for the people surrounding me that always pushed me further. I like to 'pay it forward' by teaching others to create better digital interactive products by tinkering wth code and bring joy to the classroom.

## 7. Transparency


## 8. Weniger aber besser
I like long-lasting and well-designed products.

## 9. Structured
My approach is organized, systematic and inclusive. I think in systems and build long lasting habits.

## 10. Time Well Spent
I know when to quit. I'm a huge believer spare time to explore and learn new things and make time to focus on things that matter. If your strugling with work-life balance I highly encourage you to read one of [these books.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/82448855?shelf=life)
