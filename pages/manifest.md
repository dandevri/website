<strong>Ten principles of good Danny</strong>

## 1. Make digital better
Digitale products should improve the lifes of people. It should be inclusive and delight them. I focus on digital products so everything I do is made in the browser fully interactive, responsive mobile-first, web-ready assets clickable etc.

## 3. Talk to me
The best things happen when we [stay connected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZT2AXgGzAU) and work together. I thrive on feedback and constant communication. the best work happens in a committed relationship. I can collaborate with multiple disciplines. Direct and honest communication
