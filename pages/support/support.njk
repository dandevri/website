<p>I believe in making resources and products public and free (as in freedom, not free as in free frappuccinos) so people can build upon them. My resources are free but not cheap. You can decide how much my resources are worth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want">(pay what you want)</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Why support?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You watch video's and look at slides from my talks</li>
  <li>You follow my writing, notes and useful links</li>
  <li>You learned something from my course material</li>
  <li>You benefit and used one of my Open-source projects</li>
  <li>You listen to my podcast or are subscribed to my newsletter</li>
</ul>

<p>The income from these donations and members give me the financial freedom to enjoy life more than ever before. I'm a company of one (not payed by an e-corp) partly funded by individuals like you.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for supporting me.</em></p>

<h2>Donate</h2>

<p>I donâ€™t run ads nor do I do this for profit. A donation however would help me cover my running costs. Things like subscriptions for software, audio and video gear and hosting costs. </p>
