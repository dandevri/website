Interested in getting your message out there? Sponsoring my newsletter or podcast is ideal for anyone who is looking to reach an engaged technical audience. You can share your company, product or message with my audience. My content tailors to people who like: 

* Web technology (web development)
* Design and User Interface
* Self improvement and productivity
* Privacy and technology
* Hardware and gear

I'll share the following things with my audience:
* Link to a job opening for an awesome company I support.
* Talk about why I like your product that I own.
* Share my experience with your service I enjoy using.

## Overview
**Frequency:** I send out the newsletter about every other week and record 1 or 2 episodes per week of my podcast.

**Spots:** One main sponsor on my podcast, one sponsored link in the shows notes. The newsletter can have multiple sponsored slots.

**Audience:**

A sponsored spot will get you **a link in the show notes (and website),** and a **mention in the episode**. I don't do ad reads, I'll just give a shout-out and share my personal experience with your product or service. You can however provide some talking points.
