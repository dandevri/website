Hi! I'm Danny de Vries (@dandevri), which you've probably already guessed from the header above. I like making stuff on the internet. I'm passionate about technology, privacy, time well spent, interfaces and building digital products.

> My approach is organized, systematic and inclusive. I embrace flexibility, modularity and am willing to learn but also expect to be wrong.

I am devoted to make technology (and coding) more human, fun and playful. I like to make things that I havenâ€™t made before, that's how I learn.

I live by these [10 principles](/principles).

**Lecturing**

I'm a lecturer and mentor at [Communication and Multimedia Design][cmd], a human-centred and context-sensitive bachelor-level design education in the field of interactive digital products and services, at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences][auas]. I lecture about designing for the web in the technical courses of [our program][bt] such as; front-end, [back-end][be] & [data visualization][tt].

**Speaking**

I like to speak at conferences, meetups and offices or give a guest lecture at your school or university. You should invite me. I share what I learn trough [writing posts][writing] or [online classes and courses][teaching].

**Projects**

I'm a big believer in [digital side projects][projects] and continuously creating. A lot of what I do is [open source][os].

I'm pretty good at tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, watching sci-fi series and playing indie games. When I'm offline I like to cook while listening to podcasts and [reading books][books].

_Bookmarks_

- _Movie:_ [Blade Runner (1982)][blade]
- _Series:_ [Silicon Valley (2014)][valley]
- _Book:_ [Deep Work by Cal Newport][deep]
- _Link:_ [Design Machines][machines]

**Back in the day**

I graduated from [CMD Amsterdam][cmd] with a Bachelor of Science and started working at agencies like [Fabrique][fabrique] and [We Brand Creative][wbrnd] working on projects for high-profile clients all while doing freelance projects on the side. I saw the good, the bad, and the ugly when it came to dealing with clients, project deadlines and agency culture and got fed up.
