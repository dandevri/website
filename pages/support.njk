<p>I believe in making resources and products public and free (as in freedom, not free as in free frappuccinos) so people can build upon them. You can decide how much you want to donate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want">(pay what you want)</a> and decide how much my resources are worth.</p>

<p><strong>Why support?</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
