# Support

If you like my speaking, writing, courses and projects, please consider supporting me. It helps me keep most of my resources free (as in freedom, not free as in free frappuccinos).

**Examples of resources**
* Slides and video's from talks
* The best tweets on the gram
* Course material
* Open-source projects

## Patreon
