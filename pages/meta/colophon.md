© Site made by Danny de Vries. You shall not steal.

This site is mostly powered by Hand Coding™ with a splash of [11ty][11ty] and many [plugins and packages][packages]. You can peek at the source on [GitHub][repo]. It's hosted on [Netlify][netlify]. Feel free to submit a [GitHub issue][issue] if you found a bug or  spot a typo.

No cookies or third-party tracking scripts are embedded on this site. Privacy is more important than metrics.

This site is committed to providing an experience that functions for the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. It's tested on multiple browsers, conform AA level compliance for [WCAG 2.1][wcag], audited with [automating testing services][audit] and checked with a screen reader.

Layout and components are mostly from [Every Layout][layout] and [Inclusive Components][components]. CSS follow the [ITCSS][itcss] architecture. Component folder structure is based on [Atomic Design][atomic]. Small design tweaks come from [Refactoring UI][refactoring].

I mostly used my hands to type on a keyboard but was accompanied by lots of different tools and products which are listed on this [uses][uses] page.

It was designed design-tool free™, straight in the browser without any unecessary comps and mockups. The text is set in [Simplon][simplon] by [Swiss Typeface][swiss]. Icons and other assets are created using [Figma][figma] or [Dotgrid][dotgrid].

I wanted to thank the people behind the technologies of this website and the people's personal websites I've taken inspiration from. So I did in this [humans.txt][humans] file.

Thanks everyone!
