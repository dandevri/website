© Site made by Danny de Vries. You shall not steal.

This site is mostly powered by Hand Coding™ with a splash of [11ty][11ty] and many [plugins and packages][packages]. You can peek at the source on [GitHub][repo]. It's hosted on [netlify][netlify].

I mostly used my hands to type on a keyboard but was accompanied by lots of different tools and products which are listed on this [uses][uses] page.

It was designed design-tool free™, straight in the browser without any unecessary comps and mockups. The text is set in [Simplon][simplon] by [Swiss Typeface][swiss]. Icons and other assets are created using [Figma][figma] or [Dotgrid][dotgrid].

I wanted to thank the people behind the technologies of this website and the people's personal websites I've taken inspiration from. So I did in this [humans.txt][humans] file.

Thanks everyone!
