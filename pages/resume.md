A bunch of tech things that I know about and have used. I focus on front-end and am experienced in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Node`, `npm`, `JAMstack` & `Git`, `CSS methodologies`, `Static Site Generators`, `Build Tools`, `version control`.
I care a lot about accessibility, animation & interaction, performance and modular components.
I've dabbled with `D3.js`, `Data visualization`, `React`, `Vue`, `Jekyll`, `Svelte` & `Sass`. But above all, I’ll learn anything else you need.

I know my way around design tools such as `Sketch`, `Figma`, `Framer`, `InVision` and the `Adobe Suite`. I do a lot of `UI design`, `interactive prototyping`, `UX research`, `wireframing` creating `design systems` and `styleguides`. Often doing `brand identity` work, `service design` and `design thinking` & `strategy` sessions.
