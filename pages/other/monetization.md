## Affiliate Links
Some links to products on this website use affiliate links to e-commerce websites. If you purchase an item through one of these links, I receive a small kickback (often around 4-5%). 

Some links are referral links. Whenever you sign-up using those services I get a small discount or kickback. You don't pay any extra and can even get discounts by using my links.

## Advertisement
I don't often create paid content, but when I do I fully disclose that information *#influencer*. Nobody can alter any content or my own thoughts. No short-term financial deal outweighs the long term value of creating the best content.

* Iâ€™m not paid by any company or brand for any opinion.
* I don't track your presence and am not compensated for page views.
* No targeting, no (display)advertising, CPM, Programmatic Buying and all that bullshit.

## Third-party
My content is often hosted on other (third-party) platforms. For example; I publish my video's on Youtube and through their AdSense program display ads are put in front of my video's. Just make sure you are using an Ad Blocker such as [uBlock origin][ublock] or alternatively create a [Pi-hole][pihole].

## Tips
