## The Desk

This is the place where I spend most of my time. I make a living by teaching, coding and building digital products. My 'main' machine is a This is my main machine is a [MacBook Po 13-inch](https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro) (Late 2017 without touchbar) that I use 90% of the time. I'm not a huge fan of the keyboard and the health of the battery seems to decrease very quickly. Overall not my favorite computer but it's sleek, thin and I'm pretty locked in the Apple Ecosystem.

The other accessoires on the Desk are a [Logitech MX Master 2S](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-master-2s-flow). Probably the most ergonomic mouse, it fits my hand perfectly. Lots of useful macro buttons that can be assigned to common actions within the Logitech software. I type on a [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) with Gateron Red switches and a [Wooden Wrist Rest](https://kbdfans.com/products/65-75-wenge-keyboard-wrist-rest?_pos=2&_sid=8bd1a100e&_ss=r). It's wireless and has all the MacOS media keys. 

My monitor is a [Dell UltraSharp 25-inch](https://www.dell.com/ee/business/p/dell-u2515h-monitor/pd). Dell Monitors are the best bang for your buck. It's the perfect size for a monitor and is well designed. The color calibration is superb and has lots of I/O. Additionally I use a [Dell D6000](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-universal-dock-d6000/apd/452-bcyt/pc-accessories) as a docking station to connect all these devices and have a [Elgato Stream Deck Mini](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck-mini) attached to my desk as a macropad.


### Video

Instead of using a webcam I opted for using an 'old' DSLR I had around. It's a Canon EOS 2000D. You can power it of a [Dummy Battery](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=lp+e17+dummy+battery&ref=nb_sb_noss) so you don't have to replace the battery, it receives constant power. Then it's connected via the mini HDMI output into a [HDMI usb capture card](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Capture-Recorder-Display-Adapter-Technology/dp/B088NWWSKN/ref=sr_1_3?crid=32Y6RXZG2EEO4&dchild=1&keywords=hdmi+capture+card+usb&qid=1611604271&sprefix=hdmi+capture+card%2Caps%2C173&sr=8-3). To get a clean output I installed [Magic Lantern](https://magiclantern.fm/downloads.html).

### Audio

My headphones are [Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO's](https://europe.beyerdynamic.com/dt-770-pro.html). It's a very clean and balanced reference headphone for listening to music and watching video's. Not a very overpowered bass and comfortable fit for long sessions. Whenever I need a little more punch I turn on my [Yamaha HS7 speakers](https://usa.yamaha.com/products/proaudio/speakers/hs_series/index.html). They are so pretty. My microphone is a [Rode Podmic](https://www.rode.com/microphones/podmic) on the [Rode PSA1](http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1) boom arm with a [Rode WS2 windscreen](https://www.rode.com/accessories/ws2). Everything is connected with [Stagg Cables](https://www.staggmusic.com/en/products/audio/cables/) to a [Focusrite Scarlett Solo](https://us.focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-solo) audio interface.

### Furniture

I've spend a lot of time looking for a solid desk and couldn't figure it. So for the time being I have a [Ikea Bekant](https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/p/bekant-bureau-wit-zwart-s79022810/) and two [Ikea Alex](https://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/p/alex-ladeblok-met-lades-wit-10192824/) drawers besides them. My monitor and laptop are on a monitor stand and I use a couple of [Smallrig adapters](https://www.amazon.nl/SMALLRIG-Verstelbare-Scharnierende-LCD-monitor-LED-verlichting/dp/B08B63WXWN/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_nl_NL=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&dchild=1&keywords=smallrig+magic+arm&qid=1611604917&sr=8-2) to mount my audio and video gear. My office chair is a [Ahrend 2020](https://www.ahrend.com/en/collection/chairs/office-chairs/2020/), I'm a bit taller and the back of this chair isn't the highest so I get a little bit of shoulder pain. I'm looking for a new one.
