Your privacy is more important to me than metrics. The internet needs to know less about us, not more. Just because it’s possible to track someone doesn’t mean we should.

### Content
The content on this site is all available for free. I write, edit and produce everything you see here. You can use this site’s free and open resources without giving me any of your personal information.

## Data

This site doesn't have a database (so no accounts either). This website is hosted on Netlify and creates [logs][logs] to monitor this website but also collects some [Personally Identifiable Information (PII)][gdpr]. This happens on almost every web page you visit; logs include the IP addresses, stored for less than 30 days. 

### Forms
I only collect and process data that you actively provide to me. Currently that is [Netlify Forms][forms] to parse form submissions on this site. They are send to Netlify Forms and then send to my personal e-mail which is hosted on [Soverin][soverin].

### Embedded content
Pages on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images). These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content. You can use facebook container, uBlock origin and/or DuckDuckGo privacy essentials to automatically block these third-party requests.
