  I host a #ama over on dev.to. You can see if I already answered your question publicly!

  I batch process most of my messages at the end of the day instead of constantly checking and refreshing.

  <summary>Invite me to speak</summary>
  Please read this guide for speaking. Check out the speaking page for upcomming events. I've prepared a press kit.

  <summary>You are not responding!</summary>
  I try to respond to urgent messages and mail first. If you don't have a reply within 3/4 days that usually means I decided your request wasn't worth my time. HÃ©, you are in my inbox!
