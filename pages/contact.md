# Contact

## Let's talk about your idea!

I value my time so please keep it short.

### Mail

Oh, e-mail. I have a bit of a loveâ€“hate relationship with digital letters. The most *formal* way to reach me which usually yields a *crafted* response from me.

* <a href="mailto:hi@dandevri.es?subject=ðŸ‘‹">hi@dandevri.es</a> (personal)
* <a href="mailto:finance@dandevri.es?subject=ðŸ‘‹">finance@dandevri.es</a> (business)
* <a href="mailto:d.de.vries4@hva.nl?subject=ðŸ‘‹">d.de.vries4@hva.nl</a> (university)

### Chat
*Informal* way to reach me for *quick* questions and *brief* responses.

  I batch process most of my messages at the end of the day instead of constantly checking and refreshing.

  <summary>Invite me to speak</summary>
  Please read this guide for speaking. Check out the speaking page for upcomming events. I've prepared a press kit.

  <summary>You are not responding!</summary>
  I try to respond to urgent messages and mail first. If you don't have a reply within 3/4 days that usually means I decided your request wasn't worth my time. HÃ©, you are in my inbox!
